<h1 class="calibre3">Galatians<br class="calibre7"/>Chapter 1</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Salutation</p><p class="bodytext"><span>1:1</span> From Paul, an apostle (not from men, nor by human agency, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead) <span>1:2</span> and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia. <span>1:3</span> Grace and peace to you from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, <span>1:4</span> who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age according to the will of our God and Father, <span>1:5</span> to whom be glory forever and ever! Amen. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Occasion of the Letter</p><p class="bodytext"><span>1:6</span> I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are following a different gospel— <span>1:7</span> not that there really is another gospel, but there are some who are disturbing you and wanting to distort the gospel of Christ. <span>1:8</span> But even if we (or an angel from heaven) should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be condemned to hell! <span>1:9</span> As we have said before, and now I say again, if any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be condemned to hell! <span>1:10</span> Am I now trying to gain the approval of people, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ! </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Paul’s Vindication of His Apostleship</p><p class="bodytext"><span>1:11</span> Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin. <span>1:12</span> For I did not receive it or learn it from any human source; instead I received it by a revelation of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>1:13</span> For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I was savagely persecuting the church of God and trying to destroy it. <span>1:14</span> I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my nation, and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors. <span>1:15</span> But when the one who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace was pleased <span>1:16</span> to reveal his Son in me so that I could preach him among the Gentiles, I did not go to ask advice from any human being, <span>1:17</span> nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, but right away I departed to Arabia, and then returned to Damascus. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>1:18</span> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and get information from him, and I stayed with him fifteen days. <span>1:19</span> But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord’s brother. <span>1:20</span> I assure you that, before God, I am not lying about what I am writing to you! <span>1:21</span> Afterward I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. <span>1:22</span> But I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. <span>1:23</span> They were only hearing, “The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the good news of the faith he once tried to destroy.” <span>1:24</span> So they glorified God because of me. </p>
