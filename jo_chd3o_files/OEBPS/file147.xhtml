<h1 class="calibre3">Numbers<br class="calibre7"/>Chapter 26</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">A Second Census Required</p><p class="bodytext"><span>26:1</span>  After the plague the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> said to Moses and to Eleazar son of Aaron the priest, <span>26:2</span> “Take a census of the whole community of Israelites, from twenty years old and upward, by their clans, everyone who can serve in the army of Israel.” <span>26:3</span> So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the rift valley plains of Moab, along the Jordan River across from Jericho. They said, <span>26:4</span> “Number the people from twenty years old and upward, just as the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> commanded Moses and the Israelites who went out from the land of Egypt.” </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Reuben</p><p class="bodytext"><span>26:5</span> Reuben was the firstborn of Israel. The Reubenites: from Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; from Pallu, the family of the Palluites; <span>26:6</span> from Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; from Carmi, the family of the Carmites. <span>26:7</span> These were the families of the Reubenites; and those numbered of them were 43,730. <span>26:8</span> Pallu’s descendant was Eliab. <span>26:9</span> Eliab’s descendants were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. It was Dathan and Abiram who as leaders of the community rebelled against Moses and Aaron with the followers of Korah when they rebelled against the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. <span>26:10</span> The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and Korah at the time that company died, when the fire consumed 250 men. So they became a warning. <span>26:11</span> But the descendants of Korah did not die. </p>

<p class="paragraphtitle">Total Number and Division of the Land</p><p class="bodytext"><span>26:51</span> These were those numbered of the Israelites, 601,730.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>26:52</span> Then the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> spoke to Moses: <span>26:53</span> “To these the land must be divided as an inheritance according to the number of the names. <span>26:54</span> To a larger group you will give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group you will give a smaller inheritance. To each one its inheritance must be given according to the number of people in it. <span>26:55</span> The land must be divided by lot; and they will inherit in accordance with the names of their ancestral tribes. <span>26:56</span> Their inheritance must be apportioned by lot among the larger and smaller groups.”</p>

<p class="bodytext"><span>26:63</span> These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the Israelites in the rift valley plains of Moab along the Jordan River opposite Jericho. <span>26:64</span> But there was not a man among these who had been among those numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest when they numbered the Israelites in the desert of Sinai. <span>26:65</span> For the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> had said of them, “They will surely die in the wilderness.” And there was not left a single man of them, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. </p>
