<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">א</span> (<i class="calibre10">Alef</i>) </p><p class="paragraphtitle">The Prophet Speaks</p><p class="poetry"><span>3:1</span> I am the man who has experienced affliction</p>
<p class="poetry">from the rod of the<span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s wrath.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:2</span> He drove me into captivity and made me walk </p>
<p class="poetry">in darkness and not light. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:3</span> He repeatedly attacks me;</p>
<p class="poetry">he turns his hand against me all day long. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">ב</span> (<i class="calibre10">Bet</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span>3:4</span> He has made my mortal skin waste away;</p>
<p class="poetry">he has broken my bones. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:5</span> He has besieged and surrounded me</p>
<p class="poetry">with bitter hardship. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:6</span> He has made me reside in deepest darkness </p>
<p class="poetry">like those who died long ago. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">ג</span> (<i class="calibre10">Gimel</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span>3:7</span> He has walled me in so that I cannot get out;</p>
<p class="poetry">he has weighted me down with heavy prison chains. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:8</span> Also, when I cry out desperately for help, </p>
<p class="poetry">he has shut out my prayer. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:9</span> He has blocked every road I take with a wall of hewn stones;</p>
<p class="poetry">he has made every path impassable. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">ד</span> (<i class="calibre10">Dalet</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span>3:10</span> To me he is like a bear lying in ambush, </p>
<p class="poetry">like a hidden lion stalking its prey. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:11</span> He has obstructed my paths and torn me to pieces; </p>
<p class="poetry">he has made me desolate. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:12</span> He drew his bow and made me </p>
<p class="poetry">the target for his arrow. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">ה</span> (<i class="calibre10">He</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span>3:13</span> He shot his arrows </p>
<p class="poetry">into my heart. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:14</span> I have become the laughingstock of all people, </p>
<p class="poetry">their mocking song all day long. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:15</span> He has given me my fill of bitter herbs</p>
<p class="poetry">and made me drunk with bitterness. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">ו</span> (<i class="calibre10">Vav</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span>3:16</span> He ground my teeth in gravel;</p>
<p class="poetry">he trampled me in the dust. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:17</span> I am deprived of peace; </p>
<p class="poetry">I have forgotten what happiness is. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:18</span> So I said, “My endurance has expired;</p>

<p class="poetry">your faithfulness is abundant! </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:24</span> “My portion is the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>,” I have said to myself, </p>

<p class="poetry"><span>3:26</span> It is good to wait patiently </p>
<p class="poetry">for deliverance from the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:27</span> It is good for a man </p>
<p class="poetry">to bear the yoke while he is young. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">י</span> (<i class="calibre10">Yod</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span>3:28</span> Let a person sit alone in silence,</p>
<p class="poetry">when the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is disciplining him. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:29</span> Let him bury his face in the dust; </p>
<p class="poetry">perhaps there is hope. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:30</span> Let him offer his cheek to the one who hits him; </p>
<p class="poetry">let him have his fill of insults. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">כ</span> (<i class="calibre10">Kaf</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span>3:31</span> For the Lord will not</p>

<p class="poetry"><span>3:32</span> Though he causes us grief, he then has compassion on us </p>
<p class="poetry">according to the abundance of his loyal kindness. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:33</span> For he is not predisposed to afflict </p>
<p class="poetry">or to grieve people. </p>
<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">ל</span> (<i class="calibre10">Lamed</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span>3:34</span> To crush underfoot</p>

<p class="poetry">both calamity and blessing? </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>3:39</span> Why should any living person complain</p>

<p class="lamhebrew"><span class="hebrew">נ</span> (<i class="calibre10">Nun</i>)</p><p class="poetry"><span>3:40</span> Let us carefully examine our ways, </p>

<p class="poetry">so that no prayer could get through. </p>
