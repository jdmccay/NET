<p class="paragraphtitle">The Feast of Temporary Shelters</p><p class="bodytext"><span>29:12</span> “‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh month you are to have a holy assembly; you must do no ordinary work, and you must keep a festival to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> for seven days. <span>29:13</span> You must offer a burnt offering, an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>: thirteen young bulls, two rams, and fourteen lambs each one year old, all of them without blemish. <span>29:14</span> Their grain offerings must be of finely ground flour mixed with olive oil, three-tenths of an ephah for each of the thirteen bulls, two-tenths of an ephah for each of the two rams, <span>29:15</span> and one-tenth for each of the fourteen lambs, <span>29:16</span> along with one male goat for a purification offering, in addition to the continual burnt offering with its grain offering and its drink offering. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>29:17</span> “‘On the second day you must offer twelve young bulls, two rams, fourteen lambs one year old, all without blemish, <span>29:18</span> and their grain offerings and their drink offerings for the bulls, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number as prescribed, <span>29:19</span> along with one male goat for a purification offering, in addition to the continual burnt offering with its grain offering and their drink offerings. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>29:20</span> “‘On the third day you must offer eleven bulls, two rams, fourteen lambs one year old, all without blemish, <span>29:21</span> and their grain offerings and their drink offerings for the bulls, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number as prescribed, <span>29:22</span> along with one male goat for a purification offering, in addition to the continual burnt offering with its grain offering and its drink offering. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>29:23</span> “‘On the fourth day you must offer ten bulls, two rams, and fourteen lambs one year old, all without blemish, <span>29:24</span> and their grain offerings and their drink offerings for the bulls, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number as prescribed, <span>29:25</span> along with one male goat for a purification offering, in addition to the continual burnt offering with its grain offering and its drink offering. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>29:26</span> “‘On the fifth day you must offer nine bulls, two rams, and fourteen lambs one year old, all without blemish, <span>29:27</span> and their grain offerings and their drink offerings for the bulls, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number as prescribed, <span>29:28</span> along with one male goat for a purification offering, in addition to the continual burnt offering with its grain offering and its drink offering. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>29:29</span> “‘On the sixth day you must offer eight bulls, two rams, and fourteen lambs one year old, all without blemish, <span>29:30</span> and their grain offering and their drink offerings for the bulls, for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number as prescribed, <span>29:31</span> along with one male goat for a purification offering, in addition to the continual burnt offering with its grain offering and its drink offering. </p>

<p class="bodytext"><span>29:35</span> “‘On the eighth day you are to have a holy assembly; you must do no ordinary work on it. <span>29:36</span> But you must offer a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, as a pleasing aroma to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, one bull, one ram, seven lambs one year old, all of them without blemish, <span>29:37</span> and with their grain offerings and their drink offerings for the bull, for the ram, and for the lambs, according to their number as prescribed, <span>29:38</span> along with one male goat for a purification offering, in addition to the continual burnt offering with its grain offering and its drink offering. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>29:39</span> “‘These things you must present to the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> at your appointed times, in addition to your vows and your freewill offerings, as your burnt offerings, your grain offerings, your drink offerings, and your peace offerings.’” <span>29:40</span> (30:1) So Moses told the Israelites everything, just as the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> had commanded him. </p>
