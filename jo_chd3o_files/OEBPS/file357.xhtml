<p class="paragraphtitle">Professional Musicians</p><p class="bodytext"><span>6:31</span> These are the men David put in charge of music in the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s sanctuary, after the ark was placed there. <span>6:32</span> They performed music before the sanctuary of the meeting tent until Solomon built the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s temple in Jerusalem. They carried out their tasks according to regulations. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>6:33</span> These are the ones who served along with their sons:</p>
<p class="bodytext">From the Kohathites: Heman the musician, son of Joel, son of Samuel, <span>6:34</span> son of Elkanah, son of Jeroham, son of Eliel, son of Toah, <span>6:35</span> son of Zuph, son of Elkanah, son of Mahath, son of Amasai, <span>6:36</span> son of Elkanah, son of Joel, son of Azariah, son of Zephaniah, <span>6:37</span> son of Tahath, son of Assir, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah, <span>6:38</span> son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, son of Israel. </p>

<p class="bodytext"><span>6:48</span> The rest of their fellow Levites were assigned to perform the remaining tasks at God’s sanctuary. <span>6:49</span> But Aaron and his descendants offered sacrifices on the altar for burnt offerings and on the altar for incense as they had been assigned to do in the Most Holy Sanctuary. They made atonement for Israel, just as God’s servant Moses had ordered. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>6:50</span> These were the descendants of Aaron:</p>

<p class="bodytext"><span>6:54</span> These were the areas where Aaron’s descendants lived: </p>

<p class="bodytext"><span>6:55</span> They were allotted Hebron in the territory of Judah, as well as its surrounding pasturelands. <span>6:56</span> (But the city’s land and nearby towns were allotted to Caleb son of Jephunneh.) <span>6:57</span> The descendants of Aaron were also allotted as cities of refuge Hebron, Libnah and its pasturelands, Jattir, Eshtemoa and its pasturelands, <span>6:58</span> Hilez and its pasturelands, Debir and its pasturelands, <span>6:59</span> Ashan and its pasturelands, and Beth Shemesh and its pasturelands. </p>

<p class="bodytext"><span>6:64</span> So the Israelites gave to the Levites these cities and their pasturelands. <span>6:65</span> They allotted these previously named cities from the territory of the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>6:66</span> The clans of Kohath’s descendants also received cities as their territory within the tribe of Ephraim. <span>6:67</span> They were allotted as cities of refuge Shechem and its pasturelands (in the hill country of Ephraim), Gezer and its pasturelands, <span>6:68</span> Jokmeam and its pasturelands, Beth Horon and its pasturelands, <span>6:69</span> Aijalon and its pasturelands, and Gath Rimmon and its pasturelands. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>6:70</span> Within the territory of the half-tribe of Manasseh, the rest of Kohath’s descendants received Aner and its pasturelands and Bileam and its pasturelands. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>6:71</span> The following belonged to Gershom’s descendants: </p>
<p class="bodytext">Within the territory of the half-tribe of Manasseh: Golan in Bashan and its pasturelands and Ashtaroth and its pasturelands. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>6:72</span> Within the territory of the tribe of Issachar: Kedesh and its pasturelands, Daberath and its pasturelands, <span>6:73</span> Ramoth and its pasturelands, and Anem and its pasturelands. </p>

<p class="bodytext"><span>6:76</span> Within the territory of the tribe of Naphtali: Kedesh in Galilee and its pasturelands, Hammon and its pasturelands, and Kiriathaim and its pasturelands. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>6:77</span> The following belonged to the rest of Merari’s descendants: </p>
<p class="bodytext">Within the territory of the tribe of Zebulun: Rimmono and its pasturelands, and Tabor and its pasturelands. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>6:78</span> Within the territory of the tribe of Reuben across the Jordan River east of Jericho: Bezer in the wilderness and its pasturelands, Jahzah and its pasturelands, <span>6:79</span> Kedemoth and its pasturelands, and Mephaath and its pasturelands. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>6:80</span> Within the territory of the tribe of Gad: Ramoth in Gilead and its pasturelands, Mahanaim and its pasturelands, <span>6:81</span> Heshbon and its pasturelands, and Jazer and its pasturelands. </p>
