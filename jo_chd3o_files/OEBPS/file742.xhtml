<h1 class="calibre3">Isaiah<br class="calibre7"/>Chapter 40</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Lord Returns to Jerusalem</p><p class="poetry"><span>40:1</span> “Comfort, comfort my people,” </p>
<p class="poetry">says your God. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:2</span> “Speak kindly to Jerusalem and tell her</p>
<p class="poetry">that her time of warfare is over, </p>
<p class="poetry">that her punishment is completed. </p>
<p class="poetry">For the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> has made her pay double for all her sins.” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:3</span> A voice cries out,</p>
<p class="poetry">“In the wilderness clear a way for the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>;</p>
<p class="poetry">build a level road through the rift valley for our God. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:4</span> Every valley must be elevated,</p>
<p class="poetry">and every mountain and hill leveled.</p>
<p class="poetry">The rough terrain will become a level plain,</p>
<p class="poetry">the rugged landscape a wide valley. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:5</span> The splendor of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> will be revealed,</p>
<p class="poetry">and all people will see it at the same time.</p>
<p class="poetry">For the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> has decreed it.” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:6</span> A voice says, “Cry out!”</p>
<p class="poetry">Another asks, “What should I cry out?”</p>
<p class="poetry">The first voice responds: “All people are like grass, </p>
<p class="poetry">and all their promises are like the flowers in the field. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:7</span> The grass dries up,</p>
<p class="poetry">the flowers wither,</p>
<p class="poetry">when the wind sent by the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> blows on them.</p>
<p class="poetry">Surely humanity is like grass. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:8</span> The grass dries up,</p>
<p class="poetry">the flowers wither,</p>
<p class="poetry">but the decree of our God is forever reliable.” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:9</span> Go up on a high mountain, O herald Zion.</p>
<p class="poetry">Shout out loudly, O herald Jerusalem! </p>
<p class="poetry">Shout, don’t be afraid!</p>
<p class="poetry">Say to the towns of Judah,</p>
<p class="poetry">“Here is your God!” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:10</span> Look, the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> comes as a victorious warrior; </p>
<p class="poetry">his military power establishes his rule. </p>
<p class="poetry">Look, his reward is with him;</p>
<p class="poetry">his prize goes before him. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:11</span> Like a shepherd he tends his flock;</p>
<p class="poetry">he gathers up the lambs with his arm;</p>
<p class="poetry">he carries them close to his heart; </p>
<p class="poetry">he leads the ewes along.</p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Lord is Incomparable</p><p class="poetry"><span>40:12</span> Who has measured out the waters in the hollow of his hand,</p>
<p class="poetry">or carefully measured the sky, </p>
<p class="poetry">or carefully weighed the soil of the earth,</p>
<p class="poetry">or weighed the mountains in a balance,</p>
<p class="poetry">or the hills on scales? </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:13</span> Who comprehends the mind of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>,</p>
<p class="poetry">or gives him instruction as his counselor? </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:14</span> From whom does he receive directions? </p>
<p class="poetry">Who teaches him the correct way to do things, </p>
<p class="poetry">or imparts knowledge to him,</p>
<p class="poetry">or instructs him in skillful design? </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:15</span> Look, the nations are like a drop in a bucket;</p>
<p class="poetry">they are regarded as dust on the scales.</p>
<p class="poetry">He lifts the coastlands as if they were dust. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:16</span> Not even Lebanon could supply enough firewood for a sacrifice; </p>
<p class="poetry">its wild animals would not provide enough burnt offerings. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:17</span> All the nations are insignificant before him;</p>
<p class="poetry">they are regarded as absolutely nothing. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:18</span> To whom can you compare God?</p>
<p class="poetry">To what image can you liken him?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:19</span> A craftsman casts an idol;</p>
<p class="poetry">a metalsmith overlays it with gold</p>
<p class="poetry">and forges silver chains for it.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:20</span> To make a contribution one selects wood that will not rot; </p>
<p class="poetry">he then seeks a skilled craftsman</p>
<p class="poetry">to make an idol that will not fall over. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:21</span> Do you not know?</p>
<p class="poetry">Do you not hear?</p>
<p class="poetry">Has it not been told to you since the very beginning?</p>
<p class="poetry">Have you not understood from the time the earth’s foundations were made?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:22</span> He is the one who sits on the earth’s horizon; </p>
<p class="poetry">its inhabitants are like grasshoppers before him. </p>
<p class="poetry">He is the one who stretches out the sky like a thin curtain, </p>
<p class="poetry">and spreads it out like a pitched tent. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:23</span> He is the one who reduces rulers to nothing;</p>
<p class="poetry">he makes the earth’s leaders insignificant. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:24</span> Indeed, they are barely planted;</p>
<p class="poetry">yes, they are barely sown;</p>
<p class="poetry">yes, they barely take root in the earth,</p>
<p class="poetry">and then he blows on them, causing them to dry up,</p>
<p class="poetry">and the wind carries them away like straw. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:25</span> “To whom can you compare me? Whom do I resemble?”</p>
<p class="poetry">says the Holy One. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:26</span> Look up at the sky! </p>
<p class="poetry">Who created all these heavenly lights? </p>
<p class="poetry">He is the one who leads out their ranks; </p>
<p class="poetry">he calls them all by name.</p>
<p class="poetry">Because of his absolute power and awesome strength,</p>
<p class="poetry">not one of them is missing. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:27</span> Why do you say, Jacob,</p>
<p class="poetry">Why do you say, Israel,</p>
<p class="poetry">“The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is not aware of what is happening to me; </p>
<p class="poetry">My God is not concerned with my vindication”? </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:28</span> Do you not know?</p>
<p class="poetry">Have you not heard?</p>
<p class="poetry">The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> is an eternal God,</p>
<p class="poetry">the Creator of the whole earth. </p>
<p class="poetry">He does not get tired or weary;</p>
<p class="poetry">there is no limit to his wisdom. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:29</span> He gives strength to those who are tired;</p>
<p class="poetry">to the ones who lack power, he gives renewed energy. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:30</span> Even youths get tired and weary;</p>
<p class="poetry">even strong young men clumsily stumble. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>40:31</span> But those who wait for the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s help find renewed strength;</p>
<p class="poetry">they rise up as if they had eagles’ wings, </p>
<p class="poetry">they run without growing weary,</p>
<p class="poetry">they walk without getting tired. </p>
