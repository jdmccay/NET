<h1 class="calibre3">1 Corinthians<br class="calibre7"/>Chapter 10</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Learning from Israel’s Failures</p><p class="bodytext"><span>10:1</span> For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea, <span>10:2</span> and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, <span>10:3</span> and all ate the same spiritual food, <span>10:4</span> and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they were all drinking from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ. <span>10:5</span> But God was not pleased with most of them, for they were cut down in the wilderness. <span>10:6</span> These things happened as examples for us, so that we will not crave evil things as they did. <span>10:7</span> So do not be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, “<b class="calibre8"><i class="calibre10">The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play</i></b>.” <span>10:8</span> And let us not be immoral, as some of them were, and 23,000 died in a single day. <span>10:9</span> And let us not put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by snakes. <span>10:10</span> And do not complain, as some of them did, and were killed by the destroying angel. <span>10:11</span> These things happened to them as examples and were written for our instruction, on whom the ends of the ages have come. <span>10:12</span> So let the one who thinks he is standing be careful that he does not fall. <span>10:13</span> No trial has overtaken you that is not faced by others. And God is faithful: He will not let you be tried beyond what you are able to bear, but with the trial will also provide a way out so that you may be able to endure it.</p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Avoid Idol Feasts</p><p class="bodytext"><span>10:14</span> So then, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. <span>10:15</span> I am speaking to thoughtful people. Consider what I say. <span>10:16</span> Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread that we break a sharing in the body of Christ? <span>10:17</span> Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all share the one bread. <span>10:18</span> Look at the people of Israel. Are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar? <span>10:19</span> Am I saying that idols or food sacrificed to them amount to anything? <span>10:20</span> No, I mean that what the pagans sacrifice is to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons. <span>10:21</span> You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot take part in the table of the Lord and the table of demons. <span>10:22</span> Or are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we really stronger than he is? </p>
