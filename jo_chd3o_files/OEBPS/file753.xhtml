<h1 class="calibre3">Isaiah<br class="calibre7"/>Chapter 51</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">There is Hope for the Future</p><p class="poetry"><span>51:1</span> “Listen to me, you who pursue godliness, </p>
<p class="poetry">who seek the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry">Look at the rock from which you were chiseled,</p>
<p class="poetry">at the quarry from which you were dug. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:2</span> Look at Abraham, your father,</p>
<p class="poetry">and Sarah, who gave you birth. </p>
<p class="poetry">When I summoned him, he was a lone individual, </p>
<p class="poetry">but I blessed him and gave him numerous descendants. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:3</span> Certainly the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> will console Zion;</p>
<p class="poetry">he will console all her ruins.</p>
<p class="poetry">He will make her wilderness like Eden,</p>
<p class="poetry">her arid rift valley like the garden of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>. </p>
<p class="poetry">Happiness and joy will be restored to her,</p>
<p class="poetry">thanksgiving and the sound of music. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:4</span> Pay attention to me, my people.</p>
<p class="poetry">Listen to me, my people!</p>
<p class="poetry">For I will issue a decree, </p>
<p class="poetry">I will make my justice a light to the nations. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:5</span> I am ready to vindicate, </p>
<p class="poetry">I am ready to deliver, </p>
<p class="poetry">I will establish justice among the nations. </p>
<p class="poetry">The coastlands wait patiently for me;</p>
<p class="poetry">they wait in anticipation for the revelation of my power. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:6</span> Look up at the sky.</p>
<p class="poetry">Look at the earth below.</p>
<p class="poetry">For the sky will dissipate like smoke,</p>
<p class="poetry">and the earth will wear out like clothes;</p>
<p class="poetry">its residents will die like gnats.</p>
<p class="poetry">But the deliverance I give is permanent;</p>
<p class="poetry">the vindication I provide will not disappear. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:7</span> Listen to me, you who know what is right,</p>
<p class="poetry">you people who are aware of my law. </p>
<p class="poetry">Don’t be afraid of the insults of men;</p>
<p class="poetry">don’t be discouraged because of their abuse. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:8</span> For a moth will eat away at them like clothes;</p>
<p class="poetry">a clothes moth will devour them like wool.</p>
<p class="poetry">But the vindication I provide will be permanent;</p>
<p class="poetry">the deliverance I give will last.”</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:9</span> Wake up! Wake up!</p>
<p class="poetry">Clothe yourself with strength, O arm of the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>! </p>
<p class="poetry">Wake up as in former times, as in antiquity.</p>
<p class="poetry">Did you not smash the Proud One? </p>
<p class="poetry">Did you not wound the sea monster? </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:10</span> Did you not dry up the sea,</p>
<p class="poetry">the waters of the great deep?</p>
<p class="poetry">Did you not make a path through the depths of the sea,</p>
<p class="poetry">so those delivered from bondage could cross over?</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:11</span> Those whom the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> has ransomed will return;</p>
<p class="poetry">they will enter Zion with a happy shout.</p>
<p class="poetry">Unending joy will crown them, </p>
<p class="poetry">happiness and joy will overwhelm them;</p>
<p class="poetry">grief and suffering will disappear. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:12</span> “I, I am the one who consoles you. </p>
<p class="poetry">Why are you afraid of mortal men,</p>
<p class="poetry">of mere human beings who are as short-lived as grass? </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:13</span> Why do you forget the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, who made you,</p>
<p class="poetry">who stretched out the sky </p>
<p class="poetry">and founded the earth?</p>
<p class="poetry">Why do you constantly tremble all day long </p>
<p class="poetry">at the anger of the oppressor,</p>
<p class="poetry">when he makes plans to destroy?</p>
<p class="poetry">Where is the anger of the oppressor? </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:14</span> The one who suffers will soon be released;</p>
<p class="poetry">he will not die in prison, </p>
<p class="poetry">he will not go hungry. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:15</span> I am the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> your God,</p>
<p class="poetry">who churns up the sea so that its waves surge.</p>
<p class="poetry">The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies is his name! </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Zion’s Time to Celebrate</p><p class="poetry"><span>51:16</span> “I commission you as my spokesman; </p>
<p class="poetry">I cover you with the palm of my hand, </p>
<p class="poetry">to establish the sky and to found the earth,</p>
<p class="poetry">to say to Zion, ‘You are my people.’” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:17</span> Wake up! Wake up!</p>
<p class="poetry">Get up, O Jerusalem!</p>
<p class="poetry">You drank from the cup the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> passed to you,</p>
<p class="poetry">which was full of his anger. </p>
<p class="poetry">You drained dry</p>
<p class="poetry">the goblet full of intoxicating wine. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:18</span> There was no one to lead her</p>
<p class="poetry">among all the children she bore;</p>
<p class="poetry">there was no one to take her by the hand</p>
<p class="poetry">among all the children she raised. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:19</span> These double disasters confronted you.</p>
<p class="poetry">But who feels sorry for you?</p>
<p class="poetry">Destruction and devastation,</p>
<p class="poetry">famine and sword.</p>
<p class="poetry">But who consoles you? </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:20</span> Your children faint;</p>
<p class="poetry">they lie at the head of every street</p>
<p class="poetry">like an antelope in a snare.</p>
<p class="poetry">They are left in a stupor by the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>’s anger,</p>
<p class="poetry">by the battle cry of your God. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:21</span> So listen to this, oppressed one,</p>
<p class="poetry">who is drunk, but not from wine. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:22</span> This is what your Sovereign <span class="smcaps"> Lord</span>, even your God who judges his people says:</p>
<p class="poetry">“Look, I have removed from your hand</p>
<p class="poetry">the cup of intoxicating wine, </p>
<p class="poetry">the goblet full of my anger. </p>
<p class="poetry">You will no longer have to drink it.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>51:23</span> I will put it into the hand of your tormentors </p>
<p class="poetry">who said to you, ‘Lie down, so we can walk over you.’</p>
<p class="poetry">You made your back like the ground,</p>
<p class="poetry">and like the street for those who walked over you.”</p>
