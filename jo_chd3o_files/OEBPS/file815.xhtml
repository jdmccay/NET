<h1 class="calibre3">Jeremiah<br class="calibre7"/>Chapter 46</h1>
<p class="paragraphtitle">Prophecies Against Foreign Nations </p><p class="bodytext"><span>46:1</span> This was the <span class="smcaps">Lord’</span>s message to the prophet Jeremiah about the nations. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Prophecy about Egypt’s Defeat at Carchemish</p><p class="bodytext"><span>46:2</span> He spoke about Egypt and the army of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt, which was encamped along the Euphrates River at Carchemish. Now this was the army that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon defeated in the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah: </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:3</span> “Fall into ranks with your shields ready! </p>
<p class="poetry">Prepare to march into battle! </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:4</span> Harness the horses to the chariots;</p>
<p class="poetry">mount your horses!</p>
<p class="poetry">Take your positions with helmets on;</p>
<p class="poetry">ready your spears!</p>
<p class="poetry">Put on the armor! </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>46:5</span> “What do I see? </p>
<p class="poetry">The soldiers are frightened.</p>
<p class="poetry">They are retreating.</p>
<p class="poetry">They are being scattered. </p>
<p class="poetry">They have fled for refuge</p>
<p class="poetry">without looking back. </p>
<p class="poetry">Terror is all around them,” says the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:6</span> But even the swiftest cannot get away.</p>
<p class="poetry">Even the strongest cannot escape. </p>
<p class="poetry">There in the north by the Euphrates River</p>
<p class="poetry">they have stumbled and fallen in defeat. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:7</span> Who is this that rises like the Nile,</p>
<p class="poetry">like its streams turbulent at flood stage? </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:8</span> Egypt rises like the Nile,</p>
<p class="poetry">like its streams turbulent at flood stage.</p>
<p class="poetry">Egypt said, ‘I will arise and cover the earth.</p>
<p class="poetry">I will destroy cities and the people who inhabit them.’ </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:9</span> Go ahead and charge into battle, you horsemen!</p>
<p class="poetry">Drive furiously, you charioteers!</p>
<p class="poetry">Let the soldiers march out into battle,</p>
<p class="poetry">those from Ethiopia and Libya who carry shields,</p>
<p class="poetry">and those from Lydia who are armed with the bow. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:10</span> But that day belongs to the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies. </p>
<p class="poetry">It is a day of reckoning, when he will pay back his adversaries. </p>
<p class="poetry">His sword will devour them until its appetite is satisfied.</p>
<p class="poetry">It will drink its fill from their blood! </p>
<p class="poetry">Indeed it will be a sacrifice for the Sovereign <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies</p>
<p class="poetry">in the land of the north by the Euphrates River. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:11</span> Go up to Gilead and get medicinal ointment, </p>
<p class="poetry">you dear poor people of Egypt. </p>
<p class="poetry">But it will prove useless no matter how much medicine you use; </p>
<p class="poetry">there will be no healing for you.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:12</span> The nations have heard of your shameful defeat. </p>
<p class="poetry">Your cries of distress fill the earth.</p>
<p class="poetry">One soldier has stumbled over another</p>
<p class="poetry">and both of them have fallen down defeated.” </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Lord Predicts that Nebuchadnezzar Will Attack and Plunder Egypt</p><p class="bodytext"><span>46:13</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> spoke to the prophet Jeremiah about Nebuchadnezzar coming to attack the land of Egypt: </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:14</span> “Make an announcement throughout Egypt.</p>
<p class="poetry">Proclaim it in Migdol, Memphis, and Tahpanhes. </p>
<p class="poetry">‘Take your positions and prepare to do battle.</p>
<p class="poetry">For the enemy army is destroying all the nations around you.’ </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:15</span> Why will your soldiers be defeated? </p>
<p class="poetry">They will not stand because I, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, will thrust them down.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:16</span> I will make many stumble. </p>
<p class="poetry">They will fall over one another in their hurry to flee. </p>
<p class="poetry">They will say, ‘Get up! </p>
<p class="poetry">Let’s go back to our own people.</p>
<p class="poetry">Let’s go back to our homelands</p>
<p class="poetry">because the enemy is coming to destroy us.’ </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:17</span> There at home they will say, ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is just a big noise! </p>
<p class="poetry">He has let the most opportune moment pass by.’ </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:18</span> I the King, whose name is the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, swear this:</p>
<p class="poetry">‘I swear as surely as I live that a conqueror is coming.</p>
<p class="poetry">He will be as imposing as Mount Tabor is among the mountains,</p>
<p class="poetry">as Mount Carmel is against the backdrop of the sea. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:19</span> Pack your bags for exile,</p>
<p class="poetry">you inhabitants of poor dear Egypt. </p>
<p class="poetry">For Memphis will be laid waste.</p>
<p class="poetry">It will lie in ruins and be uninhabited. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:20</span> Egypt is like a beautiful young cow.</p>
<p class="poetry">But northern armies will attack her like swarms of stinging flies. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:21</span> Even her mercenaries </p>
<p class="poetry">will prove to be like pampered, well-fed calves.</p>
<p class="poetry">For they too will turn and run away.</p>
<p class="poetry">They will not stand their ground </p>
<p class="poetry">when the time for them to be destroyed comes,</p>
<p class="poetry">the time for them to be punished. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:22</span> Egypt will run away, hissing like a snake, </p>
<p class="poetry">as the enemy comes marching up in force.</p>
<p class="poetry">They will come against her with axes</p>
<p class="poetry">as if they were woodsmen chopping down trees.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:23</span> The population of Egypt is like a vast, impenetrable forest.</p>
<p class="poetry">But I, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, affirm that the enemy will cut them down.</p>
<p class="poetry">For those who chop them down will be more numerous than locusts.</p>
<p class="poetry">They will be too numerous to count. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:24</span> Poor dear Egypt will be put to shame.</p>
<p class="poetry">She will be handed over to the people from the north.’” </p>
<p class="bodytext"><span>46:25</span> The <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says, “I will punish Amon, the god of Thebes. I will punish Egypt, its gods, and its kings. I will punish Pharaoh and all who trust in him. <span>46:26</span> I will hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar and his troops, who want to kill them. But later on, people will live in Egypt again as they did in former times. I, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, affirm it!” </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">A Promise of Hope for Israel </p><p class="poetry"><span>46:27</span>  “You descendants of Jacob, my servants, do not be afraid;</p>
<p class="poetry">do not be terrified, people of Israel.</p>
<p class="poetry">For I will rescue you and your descendants</p>
<p class="poetry">from the faraway lands where you are captives. </p>
<p class="poetry">The descendants of Jacob will return to their land and enjoy peace.</p>
<p class="poetry">They will be secure and no one will terrify them.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>46:28</span> I, the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, tell you not to be afraid,</p>
<p class="poetry">you descendants of Jacob, my servant,</p>
<p class="poetry">for I am with you.</p>
<p class="poetry">Though I completely destroy all the nations where I scatter you,</p>
<p class="poetry">I will not completely destroy you.</p>
<p class="poetry">I will indeed discipline you but only in due measure.</p>
<p class="poetry">I will not allow you to go entirely unpunished.” </p>
