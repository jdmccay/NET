<p class="paragraphtitle">The Lord Will Rescue His People</p><p class="poetry"><span>43:1</span> Now, this is what the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says,</p>
<p class="poetry">the one who created you, O Jacob,</p>
<p class="poetry">and formed you, O Israel:</p>
<p class="poetry">“Don’t be afraid, for I will protect you.</p>
<p class="poetry">I call you by name, you are mine.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:2</span> When you pass through the waters, I am with you;</p>
<p class="poetry">when you pass through the streams, they will not overwhelm you.</p>
<p class="poetry">When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned;</p>
<p class="poetry">the flames will not harm you. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:3</span> For I am the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> your God,</p>
<p class="poetry">the Holy One of Israel, your deliverer.</p>
<p class="poetry">I have handed over Egypt as a ransom price,</p>
<p class="poetry">Ethiopia and Seba in place of you.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:4</span> Since you are precious and special in my sight, </p>
<p class="poetry">and I love you,</p>
<p class="poetry">I will hand over people in place of you,</p>
<p class="poetry">nations in place of your life. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:5</span> Don’t be afraid, for I am with you.</p>
<p class="poetry">From the east I will bring your descendants;</p>
<p class="poetry">from the west I will gather you.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:6</span> I will say to the north, ‘Hand them over!’</p>
<p class="poetry">and to the south, ‘Don’t hold any back!’</p>
<p class="poetry">Bring my sons from distant lands,</p>
<p class="poetry">and my daughters from the remote regions of the earth, </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:7</span> everyone who belongs to me, </p>
<p class="poetry">whom I created for my glory,</p>
<p class="poetry">whom I formed—yes, whom I made. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Lord Declares His Sovereignty</p><p class="poetry"><span>43:8</span> Bring out the people who are blind, even though they have eyes,</p>
<p class="poetry">those who are deaf, even though they have ears! </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:9</span> All nations gather together,</p>
<p class="poetry">the peoples assemble.</p>
<p class="poetry">Who among them announced this?</p>
<p class="poetry">Who predicted earlier events for us? </p>
<p class="poetry">Let them produce their witnesses to testify they were right;</p>
<p class="poetry">let them listen and affirm, “It is true.” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:10</span> You are my witnesses,” says the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>,</p>
<p class="poetry">“my servant whom I have chosen,</p>
<p class="poetry">so that you may consider and believe in me,</p>
<p class="poetry">and understand that I am he.</p>
<p class="poetry">No god was formed before me,</p>
<p class="poetry">and none will outlive me. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:11</span> I, I am the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>,</p>
<p class="poetry">and there is no deliverer besides me.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:12</span> I decreed and delivered and proclaimed,</p>
<p class="poetry">and there was no other god among you.</p>
<p class="poetry">You are my witnesses,” says the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, “that I am God. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:13</span> From this day forward I am he;</p>
<p class="poetry">no one can deliver from my power; </p>
<p class="poetry">I will act, and who can prevent it?”</p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Lord Will Do Something New</p><p class="poetry"><span>43:14</span> This is what the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says,</p>
<p class="poetry">your Protector, the Holy One of Israel: </p>
<p class="poetry">“For your sake I send to Babylon</p>
<p class="poetry">and make them all fugitives, </p>
<p class="poetry">turning the Babylonians’ joyful shouts into mourning songs. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:15</span> I am the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span>, your Holy One, </p>
<p class="poetry">the one who created Israel, your king.” </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:16</span> This is what the <span class="smcaps">Lord</span> says,</p>
<p class="poetry">the one who made a road through the sea,</p>
<p class="poetry">a pathway through the surging waters, </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:17</span> the one who led chariots and horses to destruction, </p>
<p class="poetry">together with a mighty army.</p>
<p class="poetry">They fell down, never to rise again;</p>
<p class="poetry">they were extinguished, put out like a burning wick: </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:18</span> “Don’t remember these earlier events; </p>
<p class="poetry">don’t recall these former events.</p>
<p class="poetry"/>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:19</span> Look, I am about to do something new.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now it begins to happen! Do you not recognize it?</p>
<p class="poetry">Yes, I will make a road in the wilderness</p>
<p class="poetry">and paths in the wastelands.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:20</span> The wild animals honor me,</p>
<p class="poetry">the jackals and ostriches,</p>
<p class="poetry">because I put water in the wilderness</p>
<p class="poetry">and streams in the wastelands,</p>
<p class="poetry">to quench the thirst of my chosen people, </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:21</span> the people whom I formed for myself,</p>
<p class="poetry">so they might praise me. </p>
<p class="paragraphtitle">The Lord Rebukes His People</p><p class="poetry"><span>43:22</span> “But you did not call for me, O Jacob;</p>
<p class="poetry">you did not long for me, O Israel. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:23</span> You did not bring me lambs for your burnt offerings;</p>
<p class="poetry">you did not honor me with your sacrifices.</p>
<p class="poetry">I did not burden you with offerings;</p>
<p class="poetry">I did not make you weary by demanding incense. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:24</span> You did not buy me aromatic reeds; </p>
<p class="poetry">you did not present to me the fat of your sacrifices.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet you burdened me with your sins;</p>
<p class="poetry">you made me weary with your evil deeds. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:25</span> I, I am the one who blots out your rebellious deeds for my sake;</p>
<p class="poetry">your sins I do not remember. </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:26</span> Remind me of what happened. Let’s debate!</p>
<p class="poetry">You, prove to me that you are right! </p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:27</span> The father of your nation sinned;</p>
<p class="poetry">your spokesmen rebelled against me.</p>
<p class="poetry"><span>43:28</span> So I defiled your holy princes,</p>
<p class="poetry">and handed Jacob over to destruction,</p>
<p class="poetry">and subjected Israel to humiliating abuse. </p>
